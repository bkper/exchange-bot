The Bkper Exchange Bot keeps balance values, in different Bkper Books with other currencies, synchronized.

It works by mirroring transactions from one book to other books, automatically applying updated conversion rates.

![Exchange Bot](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTAW6vvlAPHup58L5mwdiQnUVoSxHbf890GJiHYVkLmzhAc0kaGsb8B721vc1pRFVXp2OWx8rBiACMR/pub?w=949&h=436)


The Bkper Exchange Bot must be installed on all books in a Collection. For every transaction in a book within the Collection, it records another transaction on other Books with different currencies in the Collection. 

The Bkper Exchange Bot installation adds a menu item to books to record gains and loss transactions, based on exchange rates variation.

The Bkper Exchange Bot default exchange rates are read at the moment of the gain/loss update from [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/) Any other exchange rate source url can be used.

## Configuration

The Exchange Bot works by listening for TRANSACTION_CHECKED events in your book, applying exchange rates from the an **exchange rates endpoint** and recording another transaction to the associated books:

![Exchange Bot Flow](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSgg3HznU8deJsYNuZx57XvOusDTg-t6MwNIBpF2RuJRMzz-eFY4LhbCP1giOaO1mR3pD3K1gvEIz5i/pub?w=2880&h=1248)

The books are associated by its [Collection](https://help.bkper.com/en/articles/4208937-work-with-multiple-books), so a transaction in one book is mirrored on all books of the Collection.

### Book Properties

In order to proper setup the Exchange Bot on your books, some book properties should be set:

- ```exc_code```: Required - The book (currency) exchange code.
- ```exc_rates_url```: Optional - The rates endpoint url to use. Default: [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/). 
rate.
- ```exc_base```: Optional - true/false - Defines a book as a base and only mirror transactions to other books that matches the exchange base from accounts.
- ```exc_on_check```: Optional - true/false - True only to exchange on CHECK event. Default is false, performing exchange on POST events.
- ```exc_historical```: Optional - true/false - Defines if exchange updates should consider balances since the beginning of the book's operation. If set to false or not present, updates will consider balances after the book's [closing date](https://help.bkper.com/en/articles/5100445-book-closing-and-lock-dates).


You can associate multiple books.

Example:
```yaml
exc_code: USD
```


### Group Properties

As the rates changes over time, the balances on accounts with different currencies than the book should be adjusted and by gain/loss transactions. The transactions are triggered by an item on menu:

![Exchange Bot Menu](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSA-k4mJouFSGPUc8wH2J6o67qKs7jxYkk4VygH-6WA5uwdPAw5k5Jq42MhIvznj0EszPrAlIU_pHXm/pub?w=1200&h=400)

The accounts will be selected by matching the **group names** with exc_code from associated books, or by the ```exc_code``` property set on Groups.

- ```exc_code```: The (currency) exchange code of the accounts of the group.
- ```exc_account```: The name of exchange account to use.

By default, an account with prefix ```Exchange_```  will be used for each ```exc_code``` of associated books. You can change the default account by setting a ```exc_account``` custom property in the account **Group**, with the name of exchange account to use. Example:
```yaml
exc_account: Assets_Exchange
```
The first ```exc_account``` property found will be used, so, make sure to have only one group per account with the property set, to avoid unexpected behavior.


### Transaction Properties

To bypass dynamic rates from the endpoint and force use of fixed amount for a given exc_code, just use the following transaction properties:

- ```exc_code```: The exchange code to override.
- ```exc_amount```: The amount for that transaction, in the specified exchange code.

This is specially useful for remitences, when fees and spread will be processed later on gain/loss updates.

Some additional properties uses to track converted amounts:

- ```exc_code```: The exchange base code used to convert the transaction.
- ```exc_rate```: The exchange base rate used to convert the transaction.


Example:
```yaml
exc_code: UYU
exc_amount: 1256.43
```

That will generate a transaction in the current book of amount $1000, as well as another transaction on UYU book of $U35790.76.

### Exchange rates endpoint

By default, the free [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) endpoint is used to fetch rates, but any endpoint can be provided, from other third party providers such as [Fixer](https://fixer.io/) or [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/), or build your own. 

To change the default endpoint, set the ```exc_rates_url``` book property. 

Example:
```yaml
exc_rates_url: https://data.fixer.io/api/${date}?access_key=*****
exc_rates_cache: 3600  #optional cache
```

**Supported expressions:**

- ```${date}```: The date of transaction in the standard ISO format ```yyyy-mm-dd```.
- ```${agent}```: The agent for the fetch request. 'app' for Gain/Loss update from menu. 'bot' for transaction post.


Despite of which endpoint choosed, the json format returned MUST be:

```typescript
{
  base: string;
  date: string; //yyyy-MM-dd
  rates: {
    [key: string]: number;
  }
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "base": "EUR",
  "date": "2020-05-29",
  "rates": {
    "CAD": 1.565,
    "CHF": 1.1798,
    "GBP": 0.87295,
    "SEK": 10.2983,
    "EUR": 1.092,
    "USD": 1.2234,
  }
}
```
